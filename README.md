# community-alert
OffGrid signalling and audio broadcast coordination


Idea is to have a meshtastic linked sound processor that can feed pre-recorded samples into a PA system, triggered remotely (or locally via meshtastic command from site admin's device). samples can be single, repeated, random, or multi mixed to create a cacaphony of whistle signals. Intent is to allow a device to me embedded at a church, mosque, temple, community center, etc. anywhere with a PA system for call to prayer or community announcements. The resulting remote controlled signalling would allow a community to alert on presence with the established signalling (whistles) rather than sirents or other audio standards that are signalling emergency in the community already.

Central and local command and control, with the option for human in the loop approvals.
